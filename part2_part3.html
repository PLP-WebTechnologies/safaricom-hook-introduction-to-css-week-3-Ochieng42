    <h2>There are two ways of using css in html :</h2>
    <p>CSS was introduced in the year 1996 by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie. CSS was an attempt towards the shortcomings of HTML because, until then, documents had to contain both presentational and content elements. The very first specification, CSS1, provided basic styling options for web pages. CSS2 was released in 1998, adding more comprehensive positioning and media types, along with other features. CSS3, in the early 2000s, brought a significant evolution, which introduced modules. It includes advanced selectors and responsive design through media queries, layout models like Flexbox and Grid. As mobile devices became highly important, responsive web design became essential, leveraging what CSS was capable of offering. CSS preprocessors, such as Sass, or frameworks like Bootstrap, heightened CSS functionality and maintainability. Nowadays, CSS is constantly evolving with new features and specifications regarding accessibility, performance, and user experience, which is becoming an integral part of modern web development.
